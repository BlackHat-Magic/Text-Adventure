Okay, this sounds like a fascinating project! I understand you're aiming for a text-adventure style game that uses an LLM, MCP server, and Python scripts with D&D 5e-inspired rules. And, we're going to start with defining your character races. Here's a markdown document outlining each of the races you want to include. I've tried to be creative while incorporating your specifications, rarity levels, and genetic/cultural divisions.

# Races of [Game World Name]

This chapter details the various races that populate the world,
providing information to help you choose a race for your character.
Each race entry provides a description, common societal
information, and the genetic and cultural traits that define its
members.

## On Genetic and Cultural Lineage

A character's nature is composed of two distinct elements: their
**Genetic Race** and their **Cultural Race**. Your *Genetic Race*
determines your inherent physical and supernatural traits, such as
height, natural abilities, and magical affinities. Your *Cultural
Race* represents the traditions, skills, and knowledge passed down through generations of upbringing and community.

When creating a character, you will select *both* a Genetic Race and a
Cultural Race. Some races, like Changelings, Goliaths, Kobolds,
Cambions, Nephilim, and Drakyn, have no distinct cultural
identities of their own. Members of these races often integrate
themselves into other societies, adopting the cultural traditions of
those around them. In such cases, characters may choose any
Cultural Race that aligns with their personal history and background.

Racial traits are divided into two categories:

*   **Genetic Traits:** These traits are determined by your Genetic
    Race and represent your innate physical and supernatural abilities.
*   **Cultural Traits:** These traits are determined by your Cultural
    Race and represent the skills, knowledge, and traditions passed down
    through generations of upbringing and community.
