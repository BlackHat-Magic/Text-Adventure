# Language Compendium

This document consolidates information regarding the languages, linguistic roots, and naming conventions of the various races in the world.

## Languages

### Common

The common tongue, spoken by many races across the material plane. It is a relatively simple language, with a flexible grammar and a wide vocabulary. It is the lingua franca of most of the known world.

### Dwarvish

The language of the dwarves, a guttural and complex tongue that is as unyielding as the stone from which it was born.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p b t d k g/ /f v s z x ɣ/ /m n ŋ/ /r l/ (heavy on guttural sounds like /x ɣ/, frequent clusters like /kr gr st/).
    -   **Vowels:** /a ɛ i o u/ (simple, grounded vowel system, often short and sharp).
    -   **Features:** Frequent consonant clusters (e.g., “Khr,” “Dûrg”), guttural fricatives (/x/ as in “loch”), and a preference for back vowels (/a o u/).
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure:** (C)(C)V(C)(C) – allows complex clusters at the start and end (e.g., “Khrûzd” or “Tharok”).
    -   **Rules:** Clusters often involve stops + fricatives or liquids (e.g., /kr st gr/). Vowels rarely appear in sequence; diphthongs are uncommon.
    -   **Stress:** Always on the first syllable, giving words a heavy, grounded feel (e.g., KHAR-zûd).

### Elvish

The language of the elves, a fluid and melodic tongue with subtle intonations and intricate grammar.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p t k/ /f s ʃ h/ /m n l r/ /j w/ (light, flowing sounds, avoiding harsh gutturals).
    -   **Vowels:** /i e ɛ a o u/ + diphthongs /ai ei oi au/ + tripthongs /aɪe/, /eɪo/, /oʊi/ (rich vowel system for a musical quality).
    -   **Features:** Frequent liquid consonants (/l r/), diphthongs, and now triphthongs for a musical quality, though less complex than Sylvan to show divergence.
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure:** (C)V(V)(C) – allows triphthongs in a single syllable, though less frequent than in Sylvan (e.g., “Thaɪe-lis” as /θaɪe.lis/).
    -   **Rules:** Consonants rarely cluster; vowels can form sequences or diphthongs. Triphthongs are less common than diphthongs and often appear in poetic or noble speech (e.g., names of Aelthaɪen’thar Elves or ancient terms). They’re typically word-medial or final. Final syllables still often end in /l n r/.
    -   **Stress:** Penultimate syllable, or on the triphthong if present, for a lilting rhythm (e.g., THAɪE-lis).

### Gnomish

The language of the gnomes, a complex and precise tongue that is as inventive as its speakers.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p b t d k g/ /f s ʃ h/ /m n/ + clicks /ǀ ǃ ǁ ǂ/ (clicks for emphasis or technical terms).
    -   **Vowels:** /a e i o u/ (simple, clear vowels to contrast with complex clicks).
    -   **Features:** Clicks often appear word-initially or as standalone morphemes for technical concepts.
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure:** (C)V(C) or Click-V(C) – clicks can stand alone or pair with vowels.

    -   **Rules:** Non-click consonants rarely cluster; clicks often precede vowels (e.g., “ǃak” for “machine”).
    -   **Stress:** Variable, often on clicks or the first vowel (e.g., ǃAK-lo).

### Goblin

The language of the goblins, a harsh and guttural tongue that is as chaotic as its speakers.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p b t d k g/ /f s z ʃ ʒ x/ /m n ŋ/ /r l/ (heavier than Elvish, guttural influence).
    -   **Vowels:** /a ɛ i o u/ (simple, often short) + dipthongs /ai/, /au/, /oi/ (a small set compared to Elvish’s /ai ei oi au/ or Sylvan’s additional triphthongs. These are chosen for their relative simplicity and commonality in natural languages: /ai/ as in “eye,” /au/ as in “out,” /oi/ as in “boy.” This reflects simplification from Elvish while retaining some vowel complexity).
    -   **Features:** More consonant-heavy than Elvish, with fricatives and gutturals (/x ʃ ʒ/), influenced by Sylvan’s musicality but rougher.
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure:** (C)(C)V(V)(C) – now allows diphthongs (V(V)) within a single syllable, though they are less common than single vowels (e.g., “Grai-mak” as /grai.mak/). Initial consonant clusters remain common (e.g., /gr kr sk/).
    -   **Rules:** Diphthongs are typically used in stressed syllables or culturally significant terms (e.g., tribal names, words tied to history or freedom from Maglubiyet). Clusters are still frequent at word start (e.g., /gr kr sk/), and vowels (including diphthongs) rarely appear in sequence beyond a single diphthong. Final consonants are common for a harsh sound.
    -   **Stress:** First syllable, giving a sharp, aggressive tone, even with diphthongs (e.g., GRAI-mak).

### Giant

The language of the giants, a booming and resonant tongue that is as powerful as its speakers.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p b t d k g/ /f v θ ð s ʃ h/ /m n ŋ/ /r l/ /j/.
    -   **Vowels:** /i y e ø ɛ a ɔ o u/ (rich vowel system).
    -   **Features:** Pitch accent (high/low tones on vowels), complex vowels for a Nordic feel.
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure:** (C)V(C)(C) – allows final clusters (e.g., “Storm-kin”).
    -   **Rules:** Vowels often carry tone (high/low); consonants can cluster at word ends (e.g., /sk st rn/). No initial clusters.
    -   **Stress:** First syllable, with tonal variation (e.g., STORM-kin with high tone on storm).

### Merfolk

The language of the merfolk, a complex and beautiful tongue that is as fluid as the sea itself. Merfolk is a language consisting of a sophisticated sign language and vocalizations similar to dolphin or whale vocalizations utilizing anatomy that most terrestrial races don't have. They use Elvish as their writing system, since they are culturally somewhat close to Sea Elves.

### Minotaur

The language of the minotaurs, a guttural and direct tongue that is as strong as its speakers.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p b t d k g/ /f s h/ /m n ŋ/ /r l/ (simplified from Giant, less tonal).
    -   **Vowels:** /a e i o u/ (reduced from Giant’s rich system, closer to Common).
    -   **Features:** Deep, resonant sounds; less pitch accent than Giant.
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure:** (C)V(C) – simple, often ending in consonants (e.g., “Blood-horn”).
    -   **Rules:** Minimal clusters; vowels often central (/a e/). Stress on first syllable.
    -   **Stress:** First syllable (e.g., BLOOD-horn).

### Orcish

The language of the orcs, a harsh and guttural tongue that is as brutal as its speakers.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p b t d k g/ /f s z x/ /m n/ /r l/ (harsh, guttural).
    -   **Vowels:** /a i u/ (three-vowel system, simple and stark).
    -   **Features:** Heavy on gutturals (/x/), minimal vowel variation.
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure.** (C)V(C) – often consonant-final (e.g., “Iron-fang”).
    -   **Rules.** Clusters rare; vowels short and often /a/-centric. Stress on first syllable.
    -   **Stress.** First syllable (e.g., IRON-fang).

### Sylvan

The language of the fey, a magical and melodic tongue that is as ancient as the forests themselves.

-   **Phonological Inventory**
    -   **Consonants:** /p t k ʔ/ /f s ʃ h/ /m n/ /l r/ /j w/.
    -   **Vowels:** /i e ɛ a ɔ o u/ + diphthongs /ai au ɔi/.
    -   **Features:** Flowing, musical quality with frequent vowel sequences.
-   **Phonotactics**
    -   **Syllable Structure:** (C)V(V)(C) – vowel-heavy, light consonants (e.g., “Syl-ai”).
    -   **Rules:** No clusters; diphthongs common. Final consonants rare, often /l n r/.
    -   **Stress:** Penultimate syllable for a lilting feel (e.g., *syl-AI*).

## Naming Conventions

This section outlines the conventions for creating names and compound words in the various languages of the world, with a specific focus on the use of apostrophes, hyphens, and other connectors.

### Apostrophes

Apostrophes are used in certain languages to represent a slight pause or a glottal stop between morphemes in a compound word. This is a stylistic choice that reflects the language's phonology and grammar.

**Languages that use apostrophes:**

*   **Elvish and Satyr (Elvish-based):** The apostrophe denotes a compound word and adds to the language's fluid, intricate, and ancient feel. It is used to separate distinct concepts within a name (e.g., *Aeloʊi’mar* for "Moonlit-Kin").
*   **Gnomish:** The apostrophe separates morphemes, especially when a click consonant is involved, reflecting the language's precise and technical nature (e.g., *ǃak’tunor* for "Machine-Kin").
*   **Goblin:** As a descendant of Elvish, Goblin retains the use of the apostrophe as a linguistic fossil, though it is used less consistently and often with harsher, more guttural sounds (e.g., *Grai’mkag* for "Peak-Stone").
*   **Orcish:** The apostrophe represents a hard glottal stop, fitting the language's aggressive and guttural nature. It serves to break up words and give them a more forceful, choppy rhythm (e.g., *Gark’xaruk* for "Iron-Horde").

### Hyphens

Hyphens are used to connect morphemes in a way that suggests a more deliberate and constructed approach to word-building.

**Languages that use hyphens:**

*   **Dwarvish:** The hyphen is used to join morphemes in compound names (e.g., *Kharzûd-Vor*). This reflects the blocky, runic nature of the Dwarvish script and their methodical approach to craft and language.

### No Separators

Some languages form compound words by joining morphemes directly, without any separating punctuation. This often results in names that feel more unified and monolithic.

**Languages that do not use separators:**

*   **Giant (Goliath):** Giant words are formed by joining concepts directly, creating powerful, single-word names that reflect the strength and unity of the Goliath people (e.g., *Thørmskarl*).
*   **Minotaur:** As a simplified offshoot of Giant, Minotaur has lost the grammatical complexity that might necessitate separators. Names are direct and forceful, formed by joining roots without a pause (e.g., *Brakdorun*).
