# Naming Conventions

This document outlines the conventions for creating names and compound words in the various languages of the world, with a specific focus on the use of apostrophes, hyphens, and other connectors.

## Apostrophes

Apostrophes are used in certain languages to represent a slight pause or a glottal stop between morphemes in a compound word. This is a stylistic choice that reflects the language's phonology and grammar.

**Languages that use apostrophes:**

*   **Elvish and Satyr (Elvish-based):** The apostrophe denotes a compound word and adds to the language's fluid, intricate, and ancient feel. It is used to separate distinct concepts within a name (e.g., *Aeloʊi’mar* for "Moonlit-Kin").
*   **Gnomish:** The apostrophe separates morphemes, especially when a click consonant is involved, reflecting the language's precise and technical nature (e.g., *ǃak’tunor* for "Machine-Kin").
*   **Goblin:** As a descendant of Elvish, Goblin retains the use of the apostrophe as a linguistic fossil, though it is used less consistently and often with harsher, more guttural sounds (e.g., *Grai’mkag* for "Peak-Stone").
*   **Orcish:** The apostrophe represents a hard glottal stop, fitting the language's aggressive and guttural nature. It serves to break up words and give them a more forceful, choppy rhythm (e.g., *Gark’xaruk* for "Iron-Horde").

## Hyphens

Hyphens are used to connect morphemes in a way that suggests a more deliberate and constructed approach to word-building.

**Languages that use hyphens:**

*   **Dwarvish:** The hyphen is used to join morphemes in compound names (e.g., *Kharzûd-Vor*). This reflects the blocky, runic nature of the Dwarvish script and their methodical approach to craft and language.

## No Separators

Some languages form compound words by joining morphemes directly, without any separating punctuation. This often results in names that feel more unified and monolithic.

**Languages that do not use separators:**

*   **Giant (Goliath):** Giant words are formed by joining concepts directly, creating powerful, single-word names that reflect the strength and unity of the Goliath people (e.g., *Thørmskarl*).
*   **Minotaur:** As a simplified offshoot of Giant, Minotaur has lost the grammatical complexity that might necessitate separators. Names are direct and forceful, formed by joining roots without a pause (e.g., *Brakdorun*).
