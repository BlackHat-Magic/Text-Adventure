***Language.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish.\

<note>
Language like so:

- Phonological Inventory
    - **Consanants:** /p b t d k g/ /f v s z x ɣ/ /m n ŋ/ /r l/ (heavy on guttural sounds like /x ɣ/, frequent clusters like /kr gr st/).
    - **Vowels:** /a ɛ i o u/ (simple, grounded vowel system, often short and sharp).
    - **Features:** Frequent consonant clusters (e.g., “Khr,” “Dûrg”), guttural fricatives (/x/ as in “loch”), and a preference for back vowels (/a o u/).

- Phonotactics
    - **Syllable Structure:** (C)(C)V(C)(C) – allows complex clusters at the start and end (e.g., “Khrûzd” or “Tharok”).
    - **Rules:** Clusters often involve stops + fricatives or liquids (e.g., /kr st gr/). Vowels rarely appear in sequence; diphthongs are uncommon.
    - **Stress:** Always on the first syllable, giving words a heavy, grounded feel (e.g., KHAR-zûd).
