# Minotaur

> Minotaurs are a race of massive, bull-headed humanoids, their bodies a testament to raw, untamed power. Most are beholden to a violent, warlike god who glorifies pillaging and raiding, and as such, they are often feared and shunned by other races. However, not all minotaurs are slaves to their violent impulses; some have found a different path, one of honor, tradition, or even peace.

***Language.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.

## Subraces

> Minotaur society is a reflection of their dual nature, with each subrace representing a different aspect of their powerful and often misunderstood spirit.
