***Languages.*** You can speak, red, and write Common and Gnomish.

<note>
Language like so:

- Phonological Inventory
    - **Consanants:** /p b t d k g/ /f s ʃ h/ /m n/ + clicks /ǀ ǃ ǁ ǂ/ (clicks for emphasis or technical terms).
    - **Vowels:** /a e i o u/ (simple, clear vowels to contrast with complex clicks).
    - **Features:** Clicks often appear word-initially or as standalone morphemes for technical concepts.
- Phonotactics
    - **Syllable Structure:** (C)V(C) or Click-V(C) – clicks can stand alone or pair with vowels.
    - **Rules:** Non-click consonants rarely cluster; clicks often precede vowels (e.g., “ǃak” for “machine”).
    - **Stress:** Variable, often on clicks or the first vowel (e.g., ǃAK-lo).

### ǃak’thunor

<note>
Name explanation
- ǃak- (pronounced as a sharp alveolar click followed by /ak/, approximated as “!ak”): Derived from a Gnomish root meaning “machine” or “device,” using the click /ǃ/ to emphasize the technical precision of machinery. Clicks are often word-initial in Gnomish for important concepts, fitting the phonotactic rule of Click-V(C).
- -’thun- (pronounced /θun/): Derived from a root meaning “weave” or “construct,” reflecting the act of building or assembling intricate mechanisms. The /θ/ sound (as in “think”) is not in the current Gnomish inventory, so I’ll adjust this to /tun/ using /t/, which fits the inventory (/t/ as in “top”). This becomes /tun/, still meaning “weave/construct,” adhering to (C)V(C) structure.
- -or (pronounced /or/): A suffix meaning “kin” or “people,” common in Gnomish to denote a group or community, fitting the (V)(C) structure.

### ǀen’shira

<note>
Name explanation
- ǀen- (pronounced as a dental click followed by /en/, approximated as “|en”): Derived from a Gnomish root meaning “nature” or “wild,” using the click /ǀ/ to denote a fundamental concept tied to the natural world. This follows the Click-V(C) structure common in Gnomish.
- -’shi- (pronounced /ʃi/): Derived from a root meaning “whisper” or “soft voice,” reflecting their skill in illusion and subtle communication with animals. This fits the (C)V structure and uses /ʃ/ (as in “ship”), which is in the Gnomish inventory.
- -ra (pronounced /ra/): A suffix meaning “folk” or “those who,” often used to indicate a group with a shared practice or trait, fitting the (C)V structure.

### ǂom’kalar

<note>
Name explanation
- ǂom- (pronounced as a palatal click followed by /om/, approximated as “^om”): Derived from a Gnomish root meaning “knowledge” or “lore,” using the click /ǂ/ to emphasize the importance of this concept, fitting the Click-V(C) structure. Clicks are ideal for significant or technical terms in Gnomish.
- -’ka- (pronounced /ka/): Derived from a root meaning “keep” or “guard,” reflecting their role as historians and preservers of knowledge. This fits the (C)V structure.
- -lar (pronounced /lar/): A suffix meaning “group” or “clan,” indicating a collective identity, fitting the (C)V(C) structure.
