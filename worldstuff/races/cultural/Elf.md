***Language.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.

<note>
Language like so:

- Phonological Inventory
    - **Consonants:** /p t k/ /f s ʃ h/ /m n l r/ /j w/ (light, flowing sounds, avoiding harsh gutturals).
    - **Vowels:** /i e ɛ a o u/ + diphthongs /ai ei oi au/ + tripthongs /aɪe/, /eɪo/, /oʊi/ (rich vowel system for a musical quality).
    - **Features:** Frequent liquid consonants (/l r/), diphthongs, and now triphthongs for a musical quality, though less complex than Sylvan to show divergence.

- Phonotactics
    - **Syllable Structure:** (C)V(V)(C) – allows triphthongs in a single syllable, though less frequent than in Sylvan (e.g., “Thaɪe-lis” as /θaɪe.lis/).
    - **Rules:** Consonants rarely cluster; vowels can form sequences or diphthongs. Triphthongs are less common than diphthongs and often appear in poetic or noble speech (e.g., names of Aelthaɪen’thar Elves or ancient terms). They’re typically word-medial or final. Final syllables still often end in /l n r/.
    - **Stress:** Penultimate syllable, or on the triphthong if present, for a lilting rhythm (e.g., THAɪE-lis).
