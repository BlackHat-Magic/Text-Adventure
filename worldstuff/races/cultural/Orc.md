### Gark’xaruk

<note>
Name explanation

- Gark- (pronounced /gark/): Derived from an Orcish root gark meaning “iron” or “hard,” reflecting strength and unyielding force. This fits the (C)V(C) structure with a final consonant for harshness, using the guttural /g/ for a powerful onset.
- -’xaruk (pronounced /xaruk/): Derived from a root xar meaning “fang” or “bite,” combined with a suffix -uk meaning “horde” or “many,” indicating a large, aggressive group. The /x/ (guttural fricative as in “loch”) adds a rough, threatening tone, fitting the (C)V(C)V(C) structure across two syllables.

### Krux’balam

<note>
Name explanation

- Krux- (pronounced /krux/): Derived from an Orcish root krux meaning “ash” or “burnt,” reflecting a connection to fire or destruction, often tied to mountain environments. This fits the (C)V(C) structure with a final /x/ for guttural harshness, though /kr/ is a simple onset (Orcish avoids complex clusters, so this is borderline but acceptable as a two-consonant start).
- -’balam (pronounced /balam/): Derived from a root bal meaning “ridge” or “high place,” combined with a suffix -am meaning “kin” or “tribe,” indicating a close group. This fits the (C)V(C)V(C) structure.
