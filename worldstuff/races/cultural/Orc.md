# Orc

> Orcs are a race of powerful, savage humanoids, their bodies built for war and their spirits forged in the fires of conflict. Most are bound to a violent, warlike god who glorifies violence and combat, and as such, they are often feared and shunned by other races. However, not all orcs are slaves to their violent impulses; some have found a different path, one of honor, tradition, or even peace.

***Language.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Orcish.

## Subraces

> Orc society is a brutal meritocracy, where the strong rule and the weak serve. The subraces represent the different paths an orc can take to survive in this harsh world.

> The Gark’xaruk, or "Iron-Fang Horde," are the most numerous and feared of the orcs. They are the chosen of the warlike god, their lives a bloody crusade of raiding and pillaging.
