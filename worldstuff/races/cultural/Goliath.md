# Goliath

<note>
Add descriptive flavor blurb here. Goliaths are similar to in the Forgotten Realms; they prioritize meritocracy and survival of the fittest. Their social heirarchies are purely utilitarian and generally only exist to serve a pragmatic purpose.

### Thørmskarl

<note>
Name explanation

- Thørm- (pronounced /θørm/, with /ø/ as in the Norwegian “ø” or roughly “er” in “her” but rounded): Derived from a Giant root thørm meaning “storm” or “thunder,” using /θ/ (as in “think”) for a sharp, strong onset and the rounded vowel /ø/ to reflect the language’s Nordic-inspired richness. This fits the (C)V(C)(C) structure with a final cluster /rm/.
- -skarl (pronounced /skarl/): Derived from a root skarl meaning “kin” or “band,” reflecting a group or clan, with the final cluster /rl/ fitting Giant’s allowance for complex codas. The /s/ adds a rugged, warrior-like tone common in Nordic names.

<note>
Include some example first names and surnames. Goliaths do not have "male" or "female" names; all names are gender-neutral. Additionally, unlike most other cultures, when Goliaths marry, their previous surname becomes their new middle name (or an additional middle name), and the couple chooses a new surname together. This is in contrast to the way one partner might take the surname of the other in other races' cultures.

### Ysvaðrøm

<note>
Name explanation
- Ys- (pronounced /ys/, with /y/ as in the Swedish “y” or roughly “ee” but rounded): Derived from a Giant root ys meaning “ice” or “frost,” using the rounded vowel /y/ to evoke the cold, northern feel of the language. This fits the (C)V structure.
- -vað- (pronounced /vað/, with /ð/ as in “this”): Derived from a root vað meaning “wander” or “tread,” reflecting their nomadic nature, fitting the (C)V(C) structure with a softer fricative /ð/ for a flowing yet rugged sound.
- -røm (pronounced /røm/, with /ø/ as above): A suffix meaning “folk” or “people,” often used in Giant to denote a group, with the rounded vowel /ø/ and final /m/ fitting the (C)V(C) structure.

### Hærkbrønd

<note>
Name explanation

- Hærk- (pronounced /hærk/, with /æ/ as in “cat” but slightly more open): Derived from a Giant root hærk meaning “peak” or “high place,” using /æ/ for a grounded, ancient vowel sound and /rk/ as a final cluster, fitting the (C)V(C)(C) structure. The /h/ onset adds a breathy, strong start.
- -brønd (pronounced /brønd/, with /ø/ as above): Derived from a root brønd meaning “forge” or “burn,” reflecting their smithing culture near volcanoes, with the rounded vowel /ø/ and final cluster /nd/ fitting Giant’s allowance for complex codas.
