# Goliath

> Goliaths are a race of titans, their bodies as strong and unyielding as the mountains they call home. They are a people of action, not words, their deeds speaking far louder than any promise or oath. They value strength, courage, and self-reliance, and they have little patience for those who cannot carry their own weight.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.

## Subraces

> Goliath society is a meritocracy, where an individual is judged not by their birth, but by their deeds. The subraces represent the different paths a goliath can take to prove their worth.
