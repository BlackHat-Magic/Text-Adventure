# Goliath

> Goliaths are a race of titans, their bodies as strong and unyielding as the mountains they call home. They are a people of action, not words, their deeds speaking far louder than any promise or oath. They value strength, courage, and self-reliance, and they have little patience for those who cannot carry their own weight.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.

## Subraces

They see the storm as a test of their worth, and they face it with a courage that borders on recklessness.
