# Goblin

<note>
Add a descriptive flavor blurb here. Due to Maglubiyet's influence, most goblins are violent and generally hostile. The Fraak’volk are a group of goblins that have left Maglubiyet either for atheism (in the literal sense of not practicing religion; obviously still believing in gods since they're a provable fact in-world) or to worship other gods.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

<note>
Language like so:

- Phonological Inventory
    - **Consanants:** /p b t d k g/ /f s z ʃ ʒ x/ /m n ŋ/ /r l/ (heavier than Elvish, guttural influence).
    - **Vowels:** /a ɛ i o u/ (simple, often short) + dipthongs /ai/, /au/, /oi/ (a small set compared to Elvish’s /ai ei oi au/ or Sylvan’s additional triphthongs. These are chosen for their relative simplicity and commonality in natural languages: /ai/ as in “eye,” /au/ as in “out,” /oi/ as in “boy.” This reflects simplification from Elvish while retaining some vowel complexity).
    - **Features:** More consonant-heavy than Elvish, with fricatives and gutturals (/x ʃ ʒ/), influenced by Sylvan’s musicality but rougher.

- Phonotactics
    - **Syllable Structure:** (C)(C)V(V)(C) – now allows diphthongs (V(V)) within a single syllable, though they are less common than single vowels (e.g., “Grai-mak” as /grai.mak/). Initial consonant clusters remain common (e.g., /gr kr sk/).
    - **Rules:** Diphthongs are typically used in stressed syllables or culturally significant terms (e.g., tribal names, words tied to history or freedom from Maglubiyet). Clusters are still frequent at word start (e.g., /gr kr sk/), and vowels (including diphthongs) rarely appear in sequence beyond a single diphthong. Final consonants are common for a harsh sound.
    - **Stress:** First syllable, giving a sharp, aggressive tone, even with diphthongs (e.g., GRAI-mak).

### Grai’mkag

<note>
Name explanation

- Grai- (pronounced /grai/, using the diphthong /ai/ as in “eye”): Derived from a root meaning “peak” or “high place,” incorporating /ai/ to add a slight vocalic slide that hints at Elvish ancestry. The initial cluster /gr/ remains for harshness.
- -’mkag (pronounced /mkag/): Derived from kag meaning “stone,” with an added /m/ for a heavier, guttural sound, fitting Goblin’s consonant-heavy nature. The apostrophe is stylistic, indicating a slight pause or compound structure.

### Murk'Zhoil

<note>
Name explanation

- Murk- (pronounced /murk/): Derived from a root meaning “shadow” or “dark,” unchanged for its harsh, consonant-heavy sound.
- -’zhoil (pronounced /ʒoil/, using the diphthong /oi/ as in “boy”): Derived from zhol meaning “hollow” or “hide,” with /oi/ added to create a sliding vowel sound, suggesting stealth or a hidden quality with a trace of Elvish influence. The /ʒ/ (as in “measure”) adds a softer, sneaky tone fitting for ambushers.

- -'drak (pronounced /drak/): Derived from drak meaning “run” or “chase,” unchanged for its sharp, aggressive tone with the initial cluster /dr/.

### Fraak’volk

<note>
Name explanation

- Fraak- (pronounced /fraak/): Derived from a root meaning “free,” unchanged as it already has a long vowel sound (/aa/) that fits Goblin’s simpler vowel system without needing a diphthong.
- -’volk (pronounced /volk/): Derived from volk meaning “folk” or “people,” influenced by contact with other races, unchanged for its harsh, consonant-final sound.
