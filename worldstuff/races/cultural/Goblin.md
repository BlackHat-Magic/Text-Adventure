# Goblin

> Goblins are a race of small, cunning humanoids, their brightly-colored skin and large noses a common sight in the dark and forgotten corners of the world. Most goblins are bound to the will of their tyrannical god, Maglubiyet, who drives them to violence and cruelty. However, some goblins, known as the Fraak’volk, have broken free from Maglubiyet’s grasp, choosing to live a life of their own, either by rejecting the gods entirely or by finding a new patron to worship.
