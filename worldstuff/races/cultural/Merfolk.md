***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common, Merfolk, Elvish, and Elvish Water Sign.

<note>
Merfolk is a language consisting of a sophisticated sign language and vocalizations similar to dolphin or whale vocalizations utilizing anatomy that most terrestrial races don't have. They use Elvish as their writing system, since they are culturally somewhat close to Sea Elves.

Elvish Water Sign is a sign language used by Sea Elves to communicate underwater. Sea Elves do not have a verbal language that can be used underwater since they lack the anatomy and communicate primarily using Elvish, since they are culturally still close to terrestrial Evles--much more so than Merfolk. For that reason, the signs in Elvish Water Sign are significantly less sophisticated and convey less information than those of Merfolk.

When communicating with surface-dwellers, Merfolk often adopt names that follow Elvish phonological rules, though the names tend to look very different from Elvish names.
