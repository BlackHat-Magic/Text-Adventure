# Goblin

Goblins are a small and often cunning race with brightly-colored skin, long pointed ears, and large noses. They are often seen as monstrous or shunned from society because of their tendency to raid human settlements. This unfortunate reality is a result of their god's tyrannical interventionism into many goblin tribes. Goblins are very common, about one-third as numerous as humans, though they are seldom encountered by other humanodis due to being pushed to the fringes of society and living in sparse, disorganized tribes.
