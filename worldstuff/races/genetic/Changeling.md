# Changeling

> "Trust is the rarest currency in my world, and I pay it only to those who have earned it with blood and time."

Changelings are masters of disguise, able to alter their appearance at will. They are among the rarest of races, between 10,000, and 100,000 less numerous than humans, and their true nature is often shrouded in secrecy. They dwell among other races, carefully concealing their identities.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Two abilities of your choice from among Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma each increase by one to a maximum of 20, or one of those abilities of your choice increases by two to a maximum of 20.

***Age.*** Changelings mature at about the same rate as humans and live about as long as humans.

***Changeling Instincts.*** Choose two from among Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion. You are proficient in those skills.

***Mistrust and Persescution.*** Although it is relatively easy to conceal your identity as a Changeling, those who learn your true nature may not react positively. Changelings are the subject of many prejudices concerning monstrous tendencies, supernatural fear, and duplicity and lies; most who do not know you well will treat you poorly or even become hostile if they learn you are a Changeling.

***Shapechanger.*** As an action, you can magically polymorph into a form resembling a type of humanoid you have seen. Your size changes to match your new form, but none of your other statistics do. Your equipment does not transform with you. You revert to your true form if you die or if you are subjected to antimagic (such as from an antimagic field or the spell Detect Magic).

If you choose to take the form of a specific humanoid you have seen before, you are obviously an imitation and cannot pass as an exact copy unless you have observed that individual, including their speech patterns and mannerisms, for at least one hour. If you do, you can successfully pass off as that individual if you succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by an observer's passive Wisdom (Deception) (or active Wisdom (Deception) if they suspect you to be an imitation).

***Size.*** In their true forms, Changelings range from a little under five feet tall to well over six feet tall. Their size changes with the humanoid form they take. In your base form, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
